What is Tajo?

	Tajo is a relational and distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.
	Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online aggregation
	and ETL on large-data sets by leveraging advanced database techniques.
	It supports SQL standards. It has its own query engine which allows direct
	control of distributed execution and data flow. As a result, Tajo has
	a variety of query evaluation strategies and more optimization opportunities.
	In addition, Tajo will have a native columnar execution and and its optimizer.
	Tajo will be an alternative choice to Hive/Pig on the top of MapReduce.

Why Tajo?

  * <<Scalability>>

  Tajo uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a primary storage layer.
  Tajo incorporates the advantages of MapReduce and shared-nothing parallel databases
  to yield the scalability.

  * <<Low latency>>

  We have two goals for low-latency queries.
  The first goal is to allow users to get estimates of an aggregate query in an online fashion
  as soon as the query is submitted. This is feasible if a user wants a quick picture
  rather exact results.The second goal is efficient query processing.
  We achieve it with various query evaluation strategies, query optimization,
  high throughput engine, and and efficient I/O.

  * <<In-situ processing>>

  Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) has played a role of the centralized data storage for
  data intensive computing. Collected log data and data streams are
  usually stored into HDFS. Tajo provides a scalable and low-latency means to processes
  them on location without ETL and additional data loading.

  * <<Fault tolerance>>

  Long-running queries are also required to process big data.
  Tajo supports the faults tolerance to avoid a complete query restart
  in the case that the query fails.
