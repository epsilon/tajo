Tajo is a relational and distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.
Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online aggregation
and ETL on large-data sets by leveraging advanced database techniques.
It supports SQL standards. It has its own query engine which allows direct
control of distributed execution and data flow. As a result, Tajo has
a variety of query evaluation strategies and more optimization opportunities.
In addition, Tajo will have a native columnar execution and and its optimizer.
Tajo will be an alternative choice to Hive/Pig on the top of MapReduce.
