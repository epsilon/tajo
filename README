Tajo is an distributed query execution engine. It is designed for fast
scalable ETL, aggregation, join and sort operations. Tajo is 
fault-tolerant, and it provides SQL. Tajo makes use of HDFS as a primary
storage layer and has its own query execution engine. It incorporates 
the advantages of both MapReduce and Parallel DBMS. Tajo is still in under
heavy development (alpha stage), but now you can execute usual SQL queries
except for nested queries.
